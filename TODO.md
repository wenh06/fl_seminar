# Todo list of (theoretical and applied) problems under the framework of federated learning

1. FedECG

    federated learning of ECG models (classification, segmentation, etc.) using for example

        - dataset distillation
        - ensemble distillation (as proposed in [FedED](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.165.pdf))
        - etc.

    a good resource for this problem is the dataset of [CinC2021](https://physionetchallenges.org/2021/).
